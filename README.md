# IoT-Based Security System for ATM

## üìå Project Overview

This project implements an IoT-based security system specifically designed for ATMs. It enhances security through real-time monitoring, intelligent intrusion detection, and automated alerts using various sensors and communication technologies. The system aims to mitigate threats such as physical breaches, unauthorized access, and environmental hazards.

## üí° Key Features

- **Intrusion Detection**: Uses sensors (PIR, vibration, etc.) to detect unauthorized entry or tampering.
- **Real-Time Alerts**: Sends notifications via SMS or cloud service when suspicious activity is detected.
- **Camera Integration**: Captures evidence using a connected surveillance camera.
- **Environmental Monitoring**: Optional sensors for fire, smoke, or temperature anomalies.
- **Microcontroller-Based**: Built on platforms like Arduino or Raspberry Pi with IoT connectivity (e.g., ESP8266, NodeMCU).
